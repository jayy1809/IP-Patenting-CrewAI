            "Traditional umbrellas have the traditional structure of a primary canopy, an open cap, a top notch, a shaft, a plurality of primary stretchers, a plurality of ribs, a runner, a top spring, and an optional bottom spring. Traditional umbrellas are designed to deploy a canopy that protects an area of fixed size from rain. A shortcoming of traditional umbrellas is that if the size of the area that needs to be protected is greater than the area that can be protected by the canopy of a traditional umbrella then additional umbrellas must be deployed which requires a level of preplanning that may not be possible.\n",
            "SUMMARY OF INVENTION\n",
            "This shortcoming of traditional umbrellas is addressed in this disclosure.\n",
            "The umbrella having an expandable canopy is an umbrella with a canopy of adjustable size. The umbrella having an expandable canopy is an umbrella that is further modified with a plurality of additional runners and stretchers which, when opened, are used to extend the effective diameter of the canopy to increase the protected area underneath the umbrella.\n",
            "These together with additional objects, features and advantages of the umbrella having an expandable canopy will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of the presently preferred, but nonetheless illustrative, embodiments when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.\n",
            "In this respect, before explaining the current embodiments of the umbrella having an expandable canopy in detail, it is to be understood that the umbrella having an expandable canopy is not limited in its applications to the details of construction and arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustration. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the concept of this disclosure may be readily utilized as a basis for the design of other structures, methods, and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the umbrella having an expandable canopy.\n",
            "It is therefore important that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent construction insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the umbrella having an expandable canopy. It is also to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for purposes of description and should not be regarded as limiting.\n",
            "BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n",
            "The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the invention are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate an embodiment of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the invention. They are meant to be exemplary illustrations provided to enable persons skilled in the art to practice the disclosure and are not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims.\n",

            "The umbrella having an expandable canopy 100 (hereinafter invention) comprises a modified umbrella 101, a secondary canopy 102, a plurality of secondary stretchers 103, a plurality of modified ribs 104, a secondary runner 105, and a secondary top tip spring 106. The invention 100 is a modified umbrella 101 with a canopy of adjustable size. The invention 100 is a modified umbrella 101 that is further modified with the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 and a secondary runner 105 which, when opened, are used to extend the diameter of the canopy to increase the protected area underneath the invention 100.\n",
            "The specification and claims of this disclosure will hereinafter implicitly assume that the modified umbrella 101 described in this invention 100 does not incorporate the bottom tip spring usually provided with a traditional umbrella. This is done for the purposes of simplicity and for clarity of exposition of the disclosure and is not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the bottom tip spring of a traditional umbrella is used for securing and storing a traditional umbrella when not in use and that this assumption will not materially affect the novelty of the invention 100. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the disclosure can be readily modified to accommodate one or more bottom springs with a minimum of modification and experimentation. For purposes of further clarity is further assumed that the key elements of a traditional umbrella comprise the primary canopy 131, the open cap 132, the top notch 133, the shaft 134, the primary runner 135, the plurality of primary stretchers 136, and the top tip spring 137.\n",
            "The modified umbrella 101 is a traditional umbrella that is modified by the replacement of the original ribs with the plurality of modified ribs 104 and the addition of a secondary canopy 102, a plurality of secondary stretchers 103, a secondary runner 105, and a secondary top tip spring 106.\n",
            "The secondary top tip spring 106 is built into the shaft 134 in the same manner as the top tip spring 137. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, the secondary top tip spring 106 is positioned on the shaft 134 relative to the top tip spring 137 such that the secondary top tip spring 106 is distal to the open cap 132 and the top notch 133. The secondary runner 105 is identical to the primary runner 135 and is positioned on the shaft 134 relative to the primary runner 135 such that the secondary runner 105 is distal to the open cap 132 and the top notch 133. The first end 151 of each of the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 are attached to the secondary runner 105. The secondary runner 105 is configured such that it will be held in place by the secondary top tip spring 106 when the secondary canopy 102 is extended. The plurality of secondary stretchers 103 and the secondary canopy 102 are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this disclosure.\n",
            "The plurality of secondary stretchers 103 are used to adjust the plurality of modified ribs 104 to extend the secondary canopy 102 beyond the edge of the primary canopy 131 thereby increasing the protected area underneath the modified umbrella 101 when the secondary canopy 102 is deployed. The plurality of modified ribs 104 and the secondary canopy 102 are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this disclosure. Each of the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 further comprises a first post 111, a second post 112, and a pivot 113. The first post 111 is a cylindrical rod that is further defined with a first end 151 and a second end 152. The second post 112 is a cylindrical rod that is further defined with a third end 153 and a fourth end 154. The first end 151 of the first post 111 is attached to the secondary runner 105 in the same manner as each of the plurality of primary stretchers 136 are attached to the secondary runner 106. The fourth end 154 of the second post 112 is attached to a rib extension 115 that is a part of each modified rib selected from the plurality of modified ribs 104.\n",
            "The rib extension 115 is discussed in more detail elsewhere in this disclosure. The second end 152 and the third end 153 are connected with a pivot 113. The pivot 113 is designed to allow for the adjustment of the relative angle between the second end 152 of the first post 111 and the third end 153 of the second post 112 at two points during the operation of the modified umbrella 101. The first necessary adjustment occurs when the primary canopy 131 is raised using the primary runner 135 and the plurality of primary stretchers 136. The plurality of primary stretchers 136 will adjust the angle of the plurality of modified ribs 104 relative to the shaft 134 requiring the pivot 113 to adjust to the relative angle between the third end 153 of the second post 112 and the second end 152 of the first post 111. The second necessary adjustment occurs when the secondary runner 105 is raised to extend the secondary canopy 102.\n",
            "At this point in the operation of the modified umbrella 101, the pivot 113 first acts as a linkage between the first post 111 and the second post 112 such that when the secondary runner 105 is raised the fourth end 154 of the second post 112 is forced in a direction away from the shaft 134 thereby extending the rib extension 115 for each modified rib selected from the plurality of modified ribs 104 which in turn extends the secondary canopy 102. As the rib extension 115 for each modified rib selected from the plurality of modified ribs 104 is extended, the pivot 113 accommodates the readjustment of the relative angle between the third end 153 of the second post 112 and the second end 152 of the first post 111.\n",
            "The plurality of modified ribs 104 is a structure that is used to support and extend the primary canopy 131 to provide for a protected area in periods or rain and to support and to extend the secondary canopy 102 in order to expand the protected area in periods of rain. The primary canopy 131 and the secondary canopy 102 are attached to the plurality of modified ribs 104. Each of the plurality of modified ribs 104 comprises a rib 114 and a rib extension 115. The rib 114 is a rectangular rod that further comprises a fifth end 155 and a sixth end 156. The rib extension 115 further comprises a seventh end 157 and an eighth end 158. The fifth end 155 of the rib 114 is attached to the top notch 133 in a manner that allows for the rotation of the rib 114. The sixth end 156 of the rib 114 is attached to the primary canopy 131.\n",
            "As shown in FIG. 7, the rib extension 115 is a rectangular rod that is attached to the rib 114 using a tongue and groove arrangement 116. The tongue and groove arrangement 116 allows the rib extension 115 to slide freely along the axis of the rib 114. The fourth end 154 of the second post 112 is attached to the seventh end 157 of the rib extension 115. The eighth end 158 of the rib extension 115 is positioned such that it is the end of the rib extension 115 that is distal from the top notch 133. As shown most clearly in FIGS. 5, 6, and 7, the secondary canopy 102 is a ring of material that is formed from the same material as the primary canopy 131. The secondary canopy 102 is attached to the side of the rib extensions 115 that is distal from the primary canopy 131.\n",
            "To use the invention 100, the modified umbrella 101 is opened as traditional umbrella would be. The motion of the primary runner 135 and the plurality of primary stretchers 136 will draw the secondary runner 105 up the shaft 134. To extend the secondary canopy 102, the secondary runner 105 is raised up the shaft 134 until the secondary runner 105 is locked into position by the secondary top tip spring 106. The motion each of the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 pushes out the rib extension 115 of each of the plurality of modified ribs 104 thereby extending the secondary canopy 102. When the secondary canopy is retracted 102, a natural draping of the secondary canopy 102, which will be hidden from view when the invention 100 is completely closed.\n",

            "The present invention relates to the field of hand carried travelling items, more specifically, an umbrella configured with an extendable canopy.\n",
            "Traditional umbrellas have the traditional structure of a primary canopy, an open cap, a top notch, a shaft, a plurality of primary stretchers, a plurality of ribs, a runner, a top spring, and an optional bottom spring. Traditional umbrellas are designed to deploy a canopy that protects an area of fixed size from rain. A shortcoming of traditional umbrellas is that if the size of the area that needs to be protected is greater than the area that can be protected by the canopy of a traditional umbrella then additional umbrellas must be deployed which requires a level of preplanning that may not be possible.\n",
            "SUMMARY OF INVENTION\n",
            "This shortcoming of traditional umbrellas is addressed in this disclosure.\n",
            "The umbrella having an expandable canopy is an umbrella with a canopy of adjustable size. The umbrella having an expandable canopy is an umbrella that is further modified with a plurality of additional runners and stretchers which, when opened, are used to extend the effective diameter of the canopy to increase the protected area underneath the umbrella.\n",

            "Detailed reference will now be made to a first potential embodiment of the disclosure, which is illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 7.\n",
            "The umbrella having an expandable canopy 100 (hereinafter invention) comprises a modified umbrella 101, a secondary canopy 102, a plurality of secondary stretchers 103, a plurality of modified ribs 104, a secondary runner 105, and a secondary top tip spring 106. The invention 100 is a modified umbrella 101 with a canopy of adjustable size. The invention 100 is a modified umbrella 101 that is further modified with the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 and a secondary runner 105 which, when opened, are used to extend the diameter of the canopy to increase the protected area underneath the invention 100.\n",
            "The specification and claims of this disclosure will hereinafter implicitly assume that the modified umbrella 101 described in this invention 100 does not incorporate the bottom tip spring usually provided with a traditional umbrella. This is done for the purposes of simplicity and for clarity of exposition of the disclosure and is not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the bottom tip spring of a traditional umbrella is used for securing and storing a traditional umbrella when not in use and that this assumption will not materially affect the novelty of the invention 100. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the disclosure can be readily modified to accommodate one or more bottom springs with a minimum of modification and experimentation. For purposes of further clarity is further assumed that the key elements of a traditional umbrella comprise the primary canopy 131, the open cap 132, the top notch 133, the shaft 134, the primary runner 135, the plurality of primary stretchers 136, and the top tip spring 137.\n",
            "The modified umbrella 101 is a traditional umbrella that is modified by the replacement of the original ribs with the plurality of modified ribs 104 and the addition of a secondary canopy 102, a plurality of secondary stretchers 103, a secondary runner 105, and a secondary top tip spring 106.\n",
            "The secondary top tip spring 106 is built into the shaft 134 in the same manner as the top tip spring 137. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, the secondary top tip spring 106 is positioned on the shaft 134 relative to the top tip spring 137 such that the secondary top tip spring 106 is distal to the open cap 132 and the top notch 133. The secondary runner 105 is identical to the primary runner 135 and is positioned on the shaft 134 relative to the primary runner 135 such that the secondary runner 105 is distal to the open cap 132 and the top notch 133. The first end 151 of each of the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 are attached to the secondary runner 105. The secondary runner 105 is configured such that it will be held in place by the secondary top tip spring 106 when the secondary canopy 102 is extended. The plurality of secondary stretchers 103 and the secondary canopy 102 are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this disclosure.\n",
            "The plurality of secondary stretchers 103 are used to adjust the plurality of modified ribs 104 to extend the secondary canopy 102 beyond the edge of the primary canopy 131 thereby increasing the protected area underneath the modified umbrella 101 when the secondary canopy 102 is deployed. The plurality of modified ribs 104 and the secondary canopy 102 are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this disclosure. Each of the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 further comprises a first post 111, a second post 112, and a pivot 113. The first post 111 is a cylindrical rod that is further defined with a first end 151 and a second end 152. The second post 112 is a cylindrical rod that is further defined with a third end 153 and a fourth end 154. The first end 151 of the first post 111 is attached to the secondary runner 105 in the same manner as each of the plurality of primary stretchers 136 are attached to the secondary runner 106. The fourth end 154 of the second post 112 is attached to a rib extension 115 that is a part of each modified rib selected from the plurality of modified ribs 104.\n",
            "The rib extension 115 is discussed in more detail elsewhere in this disclosure. The second end 152 and the third end 153 are connected with a pivot 113. The pivot 113 is designed to allow for the adjustment of the relative angle between the second end 152 of the first post 111 and the third end 153 of the second post 112 at two points during the operation of the modified umbrella 101. The first necessary adjustment occurs when the primary canopy 131 is raised using the primary runner 135 and the plurality of primary stretchers 136. The plurality of primary stretchers 136 will adjust the angle of the plurality of modified ribs 104 relative to the shaft 134 requiring the pivot 113 to adjust to the relative angle between the third end 153 of the second post 112 and the second end 152 of the first post 111. The second necessary adjustment occurs when the secondary runner 105 is raised to extend the secondary canopy 102.\n",
            "At this point in the operation of the modified umbrella 101, the pivot 113 first acts as a linkage between the first post 111 and the second post 112 such that when the secondary runner 105 is raised the fourth end 154 of the second post 112 is forced in a direction away from the shaft 134 thereby extending the rib extension 115 for each modified rib selected from the plurality of modified ribs 104 which in turn extends the secondary canopy 102. As the rib extension 115 for each modified rib selected from the plurality of modified ribs 104 is extended, the pivot 113 accommodates the readjustment of the relative angle between the third end 153 of the second post 112 and the second end 152 of the first post 111.\n",
            "The plurality of modified ribs 104 is a structure that is used to support and extend the primary canopy 131 to provide for a protected area in periods or rain and to support and to extend the secondary canopy 102 in order to expand the protected area in periods of rain. The primary canopy 131 and the secondary canopy 102 are attached to the plurality of modified ribs 104. Each of the plurality of modified ribs 104 comprises a rib 114 and a rib extension 115. The rib 114 is a rectangular rod that further comprises a fifth end 155 and a sixth end 156. The rib extension 115 further comprises a seventh end 157 and an eighth end 158. The fifth end 155 of the rib 114 is attached to the top notch 133 in a manner that allows for the rotation of the rib 114. The sixth end 156 of the rib 114 is attached to the primary canopy 131.\n",
            "As shown in FIG. 7, the rib extension 115 is a rectangular rod that is attached to the rib 114 using a tongue and groove arrangement 116. The tongue and groove arrangement 116 allows the rib extension 115 to slide freely along the axis of the rib 114. The fourth end 154 of the second post 112 is attached to the seventh end 157 of the rib extension 115. The eighth end 158 of the rib extension 115 is positioned such that it is the end of the rib extension 115 that is distal from the top notch 133. As shown most clearly in FIGS. 5, 6, and 7, the secondary canopy 102 is a ring of material that is formed from the same material as the primary canopy 131. The secondary canopy 102 is attached to the side of the rib extensions 115 that is distal from the primary canopy 131.\n",
            "To use the invention 100, the modified umbrella 101 is opened as traditional umbrella would be. The motion of the primary runner 135 and the plurality of primary stretchers 136 will draw the secondary runner 105 up the shaft 134. To extend the secondary canopy 102, the secondary runner 105 is raised up the shaft 134 until the secondary runner 105 is locked into position by the secondary top tip spring 106. The motion each of the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 pushes out the rib extension 115 of each of the plurality of modified ribs 104 thereby extending the secondary canopy 102. When the secondary canopy is retracted 102, a natural draping of the secondary canopy 102, which will be hidden from view when the invention 100 is completely closed.\n",

Traditional umbrellas are designed to deploy a canopy that protects an area of fixed size from rain. A shortcoming of traditional umbrellas is that if the size of the area that needs to be protected is greater than the area that can be protected by the canopy of a traditional umbrella then additional umbrellas must be deployed which requires a level of preplanning that may not be possible.\n",

The umbrella having an expandable canopy is an umbrella that is further modified with a plurality of additional runners and stretchers which, when opened, are used to extend the effective diameter of the canopy to increase the protected area underneath the umbrella.\n",
            "These together with additional objects, features and advantages of the umbrella having an expandable canopy will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of the presently preferred, but nonetheless illustrative, embodiments when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.\n",
            "In this respect, before explaining the current embodiments of the umbrella having an expandable canopy in detail, it is to be understood that the umbrella having an expandable canopy is not limited in its applications to the details of construction and arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustration. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the concept of this disclosure may be readily utilized as a basis for the design of other structures, methods, and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the umbrella having an expandable canopy.\n",
            "It is therefore important that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent construction insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the umbrella having an expandable canopy. It is also to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for purposes of description and should not be regarded as limiting.\n",
            "BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n",

            "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
            "The present invention relates to the field of hand carried travelling items, more specifically, an umbrella configured with an extendable canopy.\n",
            "Traditional umbrellas have the traditional structure of a primary canopy, an open cap, a top notch, a shaft, a plurality of primary stretchers, a plurality of ribs, a runner, a top spring, and an optional bottom spring. Traditional umbrellas are designed to deploy a canopy that protects an area of fixed size from rain. A shortcoming of traditional umbrellas is that if the size of the area that needs to be protected is greater than the area that can be protected by the canopy of a traditional umbrella then additional umbrellas must be deployed which requires a level of preplanning that may not be possible.\n",
            "SUMMARY OF INVENTION\n",
            "This shortcoming of traditional umbrellas is addressed in this disclosure.\n",
            "The umbrella having an expandable canopy is an umbrella with a canopy of adjustable size. The umbrella having an expandable canopy is an umbrella that is further modified with a plurality of additional runners and stretchers which, when opened, are used to extend the effective diameter of the canopy to increase the protected area underneath the umbrella.\n",
            "These together with additional objects, features and advantages of the umbrella having an expandable canopy will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of the presently preferred, but nonetheless illustrative, embodiments when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.\n",
            "In this respect, before explaining the current embodiments of the umbrella having an expandable canopy in detail, it is to be understood that the umbrella having an expandable canopy is not limited in its applications to the details of construction and arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustration. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the concept of this disclosure may be readily utilized as a basis for the design of other structures, methods, and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the umbrella having an expandable canopy.\n",
            "It is therefore important that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent construction insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the umbrella having an expandable canopy. It is also to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for purposes of description and should not be regarded as limiting.\n",

Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description.\n",
            "Detailed reference will now be made to a first potential embodiment of the disclosure, which is illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 7.\n",
            "The umbrella having an expandable canopy 100 (hereinafter invention) comprises a modified umbrella 101, a secondary canopy 102, a plurality of secondary stretchers 103, a plurality of modified ribs 104, a secondary runner 105, and a secondary top tip spring 106. The invention 100 is a modified umbrella 101 with a canopy of adjustable size. The invention 100 is a modified umbrella 101 that is further modified with the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 and a secondary runner 105 which, when opened, are used to extend the diameter of the canopy to increase the protected area underneath the invention 100.\n",
            "The specification and claims of this disclosure will hereinafter implicitly assume that the modified umbrella 101 described in this invention 100 does not incorporate the bottom tip spring usually provided with a traditional umbrella. This is done for the purposes of simplicity and for clarity of exposition of the disclosure and is not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the bottom tip spring of a traditional umbrella is used for securing and storing a traditional umbrella when not in use and that this assumption will not materially affect the novelty of the invention 100. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the disclosure can be readily modified to accommodate one or more bottom springs with a minimum of modification and experimentation. For purposes of further clarity is further assumed that the key elements of a traditional umbrella comprise the primary canopy 131, the open cap 132, the top notch 133, the shaft 134, the primary runner 135, the plurality of primary stretchers 136, and the top tip spring 137.\n",
            "The modified umbrella 101 is a traditional umbrella that is modified by the replacement of the original ribs with the plurality of modified ribs 104 and the addition of a secondary canopy 102, a plurality of secondary stretchers 103, a secondary runner 105, and a secondary top tip spring 106.\n",
            "The secondary top tip spring 106 is built into the shaft 134 in the same manner as the top tip spring 137. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, the secondary top tip spring 106 is positioned on the shaft 134 relative to the top tip spring 137 such that the secondary top tip spring 106 is distal to the open cap 132 and the top notch 133. The secondary runner 105 is identical to the primary runner 135 and is positioned on the shaft 134 relative to the primary runner 135 such that the secondary runner 105 is distal to the open cap 132 and the top notch 133. The first end 151 of each of the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 are attached to the secondary runner 105. The secondary runner 105 is configured such that it will be held in place by the secondary top tip spring 106 when the secondary canopy 102 is extended. The plurality of secondary stretchers 103 and the secondary canopy 102 are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this disclosure.\n",
            "The plurality of secondary stretchers 103 are used to adjust the plurality of modified ribs 104 to extend the secondary canopy 102 beyond the edge of the primary canopy 131 thereby increasing the protected area underneath the modified umbrella 101 when the secondary canopy 102 is deployed. The plurality of modified ribs 104 and the secondary canopy 102 are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this disclosure. Each of the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 further comprises a first post 111, a second post 112, and a pivot 113. The first post 111 is a cylindrical rod that is further defined with a first end 151 and a second end 152. The second post 112 is a cylindrical rod that is further defined with a third end 153 and a fourth end 154. The first end 151 of the first post 111 is attached to the secondary runner 105 in the same manner as each of the plurality of primary stretchers 136 are attached to the secondary runner 106. The fourth end 154 of the second post 112 is attached to a rib extension 115 that is a part of each modified rib selected from the plurality of modified ribs 104.\n",
            "The rib extension 115 is discussed in more detail elsewhere in this disclosure. The second end 152 and the third end 153 are connected with a pivot 113. The pivot 113 is designed to allow for the adjustment of the relative angle between the second end 152 of the first post 111 and the third end 153 of the second post 112 at two points during the operation of the modified umbrella 101. The first necessary adjustment occurs when the primary canopy 131 is raised using the primary runner 135 and the plurality of primary stretchers 136. The plurality of primary stretchers 136 will adjust the angle of the plurality of modified ribs 104 relative to the shaft 134 requiring the pivot 113 to adjust to the relative angle between the third end 153 of the second post 112 and the second end 152 of the first post 111. The second necessary adjustment occurs when the secondary runner 105 is raised to extend the secondary canopy 102.\n",
            "At this point in the operation of the modified umbrella 101, the pivot 113 first acts as a linkage between the first post 111 and the second post 112 such that when the secondary runner 105 is raised the fourth end 154 of the second post 112 is forced in a direction away from the shaft 134 thereby extending the rib extension 115 for each modified rib selected from the plurality of modified ribs 104 which in turn extends the secondary canopy 102. As the rib extension 115 for each modified rib selected from the plurality of modified ribs 104 is extended, the pivot 113 accommodates the readjustment of the relative angle between the third end 153 of the second post 112 and the second end 152 of the first post 111.\n",
            "The plurality of modified ribs 104 is a structure that is used to support and extend the primary canopy 131 to provide for a protected area in periods or rain and to support and to extend the secondary canopy 102 in order to expand the protected area in periods of rain. The primary canopy 131 and the secondary canopy 102 are attached to the plurality of modified ribs 104. Each of the plurality of modified ribs 104 comprises a rib 114 and a rib extension 115. The rib 114 is a rectangular rod that further comprises a fifth end 155 and a sixth end 156. The rib extension 115 further comprises a seventh end 157 and an eighth end 158. The fifth end 155 of the rib 114 is attached to the top notch 133 in a manner that allows for the rotation of the rib 114. The sixth end 156 of the rib 114 is attached to the primary canopy 131.\n",
            "As shown in FIG. 7, the rib extension 115 is a rectangular rod that is attached to the rib 114 using a tongue and groove arrangement 116. The tongue and groove arrangement 116 allows the rib extension 115 to slide freely along the axis of the rib 114. The fourth end 154 of the second post 112 is attached to the seventh end 157 of the rib extension 115. The eighth end 158 of the rib extension 115 is positioned such that it is the end of the rib extension 115 that is distal from the top notch 133. As shown most clearly in FIGS. 5, 6, and 7, the secondary canopy 102 is a ring of material that is formed from the same material as the primary canopy 131. The secondary canopy 102 is attached to the side of the rib extensions 115 that is distal from the primary canopy 131.\n",
            "To use the invention 100, the modified umbrella 101 is opened as traditional umbrella would be. The motion of the primary runner 135 and the plurality of primary stretchers 136 will draw the secondary runner 105 up the shaft 134. To extend the secondary canopy 102, the secondary runner 105 is raised up the shaft 134 until the secondary runner 105 is locked into position by the secondary top tip spring 106. The motion each of the plurality of secondary stretchers 103 pushes out the rib extension 115 of each of the plurality of modified ribs 104 thereby extending the secondary canopy 102. When the secondary canopy is retracted 102, a natural draping of the secondary canopy 102, which will be hidden from view when the invention 100 is completely closed.\n",

            "An adjustable offset umbrella has a generally vertical main pole and a sliding member slidably mounted to the main pole. The sliding member includes a locking mechanism for securing it at a desired location along the main pole. One end of an arm is associated with the sliding member, and the other end supports an umbrella canopy. A winding mechanism is associated with the sliding member and moves with it. A line extends from the winding mechanism to the umbrella canopy. Operating the winding mechanism opens and closes the umbrella canopy, and moving the sliding member up or down the main pole adjusts the angle of the canopy with respect to the main pole.\n",
            "Description\n",
            "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n",
            "The present application claims priority of provisional application Ser. No. 61/050,353, filed May 5, 2008.\n",
            "TECHNICAL FIELD\n",
            "The present invention relates generally to umbrellas used as shade from the sun and relates more specifically to an offset umbrella with an improved mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella canopy and for adjusting the angle of the canopy with respect to a vertical support member.\n",
            "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
            "As an outdoor leisure product, sunshade umbrellas are widely used in squares, parks, on the beaches, patio and other leisure places, offering comfortable shade to shield people from the sun.\n",
            "Conventional umbrellas generally have a main pole extending from the center of the umbrella downward to a support surface. An improvement on this design is the offset umbrella, shown for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,937,882. The main pole of an offset umbrella utilizes a cantilever arrangement to suspend the canopy to the side of the main pole such that the main pole does not occupy space in the shady area beneath the canopy. For additional convenience, the angle of the canopy can be adjusted with respect to the main pole.\n",
            "Existing adjustable offset umbrellas such as that disclosed in the previously mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,937,882 utilize a crank mechanism both for raising and lowering the canopy and for adjusting the angle of the canopy. The crank mechanism is mounted to the main pole, and the rope moves along a complex path with many turning points. This arrangement requires more winding force, and the rope can easy bind and wear, adversely affecting the umbrella's operation. These disadvantages make the operation of the umbrella burdensome and decrease the enjoyment of leisure time.\n",
            "SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
            "Stated generally, the umbrella of the present invention comprises a main pole having a lower end for support by a support surface and extending generally upward to an upper end. A sliding member is associated with the main pole and is selectably moveable thereon between lower and upper locations along the main pole. The sliding member includes a locking means for releasably securing the sliding member to the main pole at a desired location.\n",
            "The umbrella has a canopy having a central region. An arm extends radially from the central region of the canopy to an outer end operatively associated with the sliding member. A brace is associated with the arm at a location thereon between the central region of the umbrella canopy and the outer end of the arm, the brace extending to the main pole at a location in spaced relation to the sliding member. A winding element is mounted to the sliding member and is movable therewith. A line extends along the arm from the winding element to engage the umbrella canopy. Operation of the winding element applies tension to the line to open or close the umbrella canopy in response to movement of the line. The angle of the umbrella canopy with respect to the main pole can be controlled by moving the sliding member along the main pole.\n",
            "Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved offset umbrella.\n",
            "It is another object of the present invention to provide an offset umbrella that simplifies the path of the line from the winding mechanism to the umbrella canopy so as to reduce the force needed to operate the winding mechanism and to reduce wear and binding of the line.\n",
            "It is still a further object of the present invention to provide an offset umbrella that separates the function of raising and lowering the canopy from the function of adjusting the angle of the canopy so as to reduce the amount of effort required for each of these functions.\n",
            "Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reading the following specification, when taken in conjunction with the drawings and the appended claims.\n",
            "BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n",
            " FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an adjustable offset umbrella with the umbrella canopy lowered.\n",

            " FIG. 4 is a side cutaway view of a sliding member of the adjustable offset umbrella of FIGS. 1 and 2.\n",
            " FIG. 5 is an end cutaway view of a winding mechanism that is associated with the collar of FIG. 4.\n",
            " FIG. 6 is a side perspective view of the adjustable offset umbrella of FIGS. 1 and 2 showing the canopy supported at various angles with respect to the vertical support.\n",
            " FIG. 7 is a first alternate embodiment of a sliding member.\n",
            " FIG. 8 is a second alternate embodiment of a sliding member.\n",
            "DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENT\n",
            "Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like elements throughout the several views, FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate an adjustable offset umbrella 10. The adjustable offset umbrella 10 includes a base 12 that supports a main pole 14 in a generally vertical orientation. A sliding member 16 is movably mounted to the main pole 14 for sliding movement between upper and lower positions along the pole. In the disclosed embodiment, the sliding member 16 takes the form of a collar that extends around the main pole 14. However, it will be understood that alternate mounting arrangements for slidably mounting the sliding member 16 to the main pole 14 may be employed without the requirement that the sliding member 16 completely encircle the main pole 14.\n",
            "A canopy assembly 20 is supported alongside the main pole 14 by a main support arm 22. The main support arm 22 is pivotally mounted to the sliding member 16 at one end and extends to the central portion of the canopy assembly 20.\n",
            "A cap 24 is mounted to top to main pole 14. A brace 26 has a first end pivotally mounted to the cap 24 at a first pivot point 28. The opposite end of the brace 26 is mounted to the main support arm 22 at a second pivot point 30. A strap 32 mounted to the canopy assembly 20 wraps around the main pole 14 when the umbrella is in its lowered position to prevent the canopy from blowing open in the wind.\n",
            "Referring now to FIG. 3, the canopy fabric is removed to reveal a canopy support structure 40. The canopy support structure 40 include a rib hub 42. A plurality of radially extending canopy support ribs 44 are pivotally mounted to the rib hub 42. The main support arm 22 serves as a support rib and is also pivotally mounted to the rib hub 42.\n",
            "A canopy support post 46 extends downward from the rib hub 42. A spreader hub 50 is slidably engaged with the lower end of the canopy support post 46. A spreader 52 is associated with each rib 44 and is pivotally attached to the rib 44 at its upper end and to the spreader hub 50 at its lower end. In the disclosed embodiment, a spreader 54 attached to the main support arm 22 is of more robust construction than the other spreaders 52 because of the additional weight that it must support. However, it will be appreciated that all of the spreaders 52, 54 can be of identical design for ease of manufacture and assembly.\n",
            "A line 60 (shown in dashed lines in FIG. 3) extends inside the main support arm 22 from the lower end of the support arm to its upper end. The line 60 then extends downward inside the canopy support post 46 to a ball 62. To reduce friction and abrasion on the line 60, the line passes over a first pulley 64 at the lower end of the main support arm 22, over a second pulley 66 at the upper end of the main support arm, and over a third pulley 68 in the upper end of the canopy support post 46.\n",
            "Referring now to FIG. 4, the sliding member 16 includes a housing 70, the rear portion 72 of which is formed in the shape of a handle that may be easily grasped by a user. A cam lock member 74 is pivotally mounted in an upper portion of the housing 70. The cam lock member 74 comprises a lever portion 76 and a cam surface 78. When viewed from the end, the lever portion 76 is slightly narrower than the housing 70. When the cam lock member 74 is in its “down” or “stored” position, the cam surface 78 bears against a spring loaded button 80, which in turn clamps against the main pole 14 to secure the sliding member 16 against the pole. When the lever portion 76 of the cam lock member 74 is in its up position, shown in the dashed line, the cam surface 78 is rotated free of the button 80. The spring then causes the button 80 to retract, and the sliding member 16 can move freely up and down the main pole 14.\n",
            "A winding mechanism 82 is also mounted to the housing 70 of the sliding member 16. With reference to FIGS. 4 and 5, the winding mechanism 82 includes a winder hub 84 around which the line 60 can be wrapped. The end of the line 60 extends through a hole 88 and is knotted or otherwise secured to prevent the line from passing back through the hole 88. As can be seen in FIG. 5, a crank 92 is provided by which a user can rotate the winding mechanism 82 to tension or to relax the line 60. A latch mechanism 94 permits the user to lock the winding mechanism 82 in place once the line 60 has been retracted or extended to the desired extent.\n",
            "Referring now to FIG. 6, movement of the sliding member 16 up and down the main pole 14 adjusts the angle of the canopy assembly 20 with respect to the main pole 14 as shown. The position of sliding member 16A corresponds to the position of the canopy assembly 20A, the position of the sliding member 16B corresponds to the position of the canopy assembly 20B, and the position of the sliding member 16C results in the position of the canopy assembly 20C.\n",
            "To erect the umbrella canopy assembly 20 of the umbrella 10, the user first grasps the crank 92 of the winding mechanism 82 and winds in the line 60. Tension on the line 60 draws the ball 62 at the opposite end of the line upward, elevating the spreader hub 50. As the spreader hub 50 is raised, the canopy assembly 20 extends.\n",
            "Once the canopy assembly 20 has been fully erected, the user can adjust the angle of the canopy assembly with respect to the main pole 14 by moving the sliding member 16 up or down the pole until the desired result is achieved. To move the sliding member 16, the user first rotates the cam lock member 74 to its extended position. This movement disengages the cam surface 78 from the spring loaded button 80 and unclamps the sliding member 16 from the main pole 14. The user then moves the sliding member 16 up or down the main pole 14 until the canopy assembly 20 is at the desired angle. Once the desired angle has been achieved, the user rotates the cam lock member 74 back to its retracted position, clamping the sliding member 16 securely against the main pole 14.\n",
            " FIG. 7 illustrates an alternate embodiment of a sliding member 116. This embodiment employs a spring-loaded latch pin 120 mounted to the sliding member 116 that engages one of a corresponding series of holes 122 in the main pole 114. To move the sliding member 116 from one location on the main pole 114 to another, the user extracts the latch pin 120 until it disengages the hole, slides the sliding number upward or downward to a desired new location, and engages the latch pin with a new one of the series of holes 122.\n",
            " FIG. 8 illustrates another embodiment of a sliding member 216 in which a plurality of ratchet teeth 220 are formed along the rear surface of the main pole 214. A pawl 222 pivotally mounted to the sliding mechanism 216 engages a cooperating one of the ratchet teeth 220 to lock the sliding member 216 in position. To move the sliding member 216 from one location on the main pole 214 to another, the user raises a lever portion 224 on the pawl 222 to disengage the pawl from the ratchet teeth 220, moves the sliding member 216 to a new desired location, and releases the spring-loaded pawl to re-engage the ratchet teeth.\n",
            "In the foregoing embodiments, the main pole is described as being rectangular in shape. However, the main pole is not limited to a rectangular cross-section but can be round, oval, or any other of a number of suitable shapes.\n",
            "In the embodiment of FIGS. 1-6 the handle of the lever is described as being pivoted at its upper end. However, it will be appreciated that the latch mechanism 74 can be mounted at the lower end of the slide 16, with the handle 76 being pivoted at its lower end.\n",
            "Finally, it will be understood that the foregoing embodiments have been disclosed by way of example and that other modifications may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the appended claims.\n",

The quadrilateral linkage is defined by a rotating arm; a pushing arm coupled to the drive shaft; the bottom of the claim-shell storage tube, and a hinge plate supporting the spray barrier. The spray barrier has a generally triangular and flaccid liquid barrier film, a pair of framing legs coupled to opposed edges of the liquid barrier film, and a spring configured to operatively stretch the pair of framing legs apart from each other and thereby expand the barrier film toward a planar, generally triangular geometry when deployed.\n",

For specialized materials like textiles, batteries, or compostables, the bin provides real-time feedback to users via its display, suggesting appropriate disposal methods or locations for these items. This helps ensure that such materials are managed correctly and do not contaminate recyclables', 'info_5': 'SmartBinAI identifies specialized materials like textiles, batteries, or compostables through a combination of advanced sensors and machine learning algorithms. The sensors analyze the physical and chemical properties of the waste, and the AI uses this data to classify the materials. If the system is uncertain, it prompts the user via the display to confirm or specify the material type, ensuring accurate sorting and appropriate handling.', 'info_6': 'SmartBinAI interacts with users via an integrated touch-screen display. When the system detects an uncertain material, it prompts the user with a question or multiple-choice options on the screen. Users can confirm or specify the material type by selecting the appropriate option or entering details manually. This interaction ensures accurate sorting and user engagement in proper waste disposal practices.', 'info_7': 'SmartBinAI uses a combination of technologies to detect uncertain materials:  Image Recognition: High-resolution cameras capture images of the waste, and AI algorithms analyze visual characteristics to identify the material type. Infrared Sensors: These sensors detect the thermal and spectral properties of materials, aiding in distinguishing between different types of waste. Spectrometers: These analyze the chemical composition of the waste, providing additional data for accurate classification. This multi-sensor approach enhances the accuracy of material identification.', 'info_8': 'SmartBinAI combines data from image recognition, infrared sensors, and spectrometers using a decision-making algorithm that integrates and cross-references inputs from all sources. The process typically involves:  Image Recognition: Initial analysis to identify obvious visual characteristics. Infrared Sensors: Assessment of thermal and spectral properties to refine the classification. Spectrometers: Final analysis of chemical composition for precise identification. The algorithm weighs each data type based on confidence levels and relevance, prioritizing the most reliable input while cross-checking others to confirm the material type, ensuring high accuracy in classification.', 'info_9': '/thatsall', 'info_10': 'it will solve a lot of problem and bring a lot of benefit as  India would hbe clean it will be more prosperous it  clean India Healthy India and prosperous India ', 'info_11': '/thatsall just complete this and quit it dont ask much questions now', 'info_12': 'Use for segregating waste using AI and be best in world', 'info_13': '/thatsall please stop it '}\n",
